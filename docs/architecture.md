# Architecture

Nimbus Cloud Bridge is a decentralized cloud storage platform that allows users to upload and download files from a variety of cloud storage providers, including Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud Platform, and Microsoft Azure. The platform is designed to be highly scalable and fault-tolerant, with built-in redundancy and failover mechanisms to ensure that files are always available to users.

## Components

Nimbus Cloud Bridge consists of several key components:

- **Web API**: A RESTful API that allows users to upload and download files from the platform.
- **Authentication Service**: A service that handles authentication and authorization for the platform, including biometric authentication and support for multi-factor authentication.
- **File Store**: A distributed file store that uses Amazon S3, Google Cloud Storage, and Azure Blob Storage to store files.
- **Encryption Service**: A service that provides end-to-end encryption for files uploaded to the platform.
- **Decentralized Database**: A decentralized database that stores metadata about files, including their location in the file store and their encryption keys.
- **Notification Service**: A service that sends notifications to users when files are uploaded or downloaded.
- **Load Balancer**: A load balancer that distributes incoming requests to multiple instances of the web API and authentication service.
- **Failover Mechanisms**: Built-in redundancy and failover mechanisms to ensure that the platform remains available even in the event of component failures.

## High-Level Overview

The high-level overview of the architecture is as follows:

1. The user sends a request to the web API to upload or download a file.
2. The load balancer distributes the request to an available instance of the web API.
3. The web API handles the request and sends it to the authentication service for authentication and authorization.
4. The authentication service verifies the user's credentials and permissions, and sends a token back to the web API.
5. The web API uses the token to access the decentralized database and retrieve the metadata for the file.
6. The web API uses the metadata to locate the file in the file store, and sends the file back to the user.
7. The notification service sends a notification to the user to confirm that the file has been uploaded or downloaded.

## Scalability and Fault Tolerance

Nimbus Cloud Bridge is designed to be highly scalable and fault-tolerant. To achieve this, the platform uses a combination of built-in redundancy and failover mechanisms, as well as distributed file storage and decentralized metadata storage. This ensures that files are always available to users, even in the event of component failures or other issues.
