# Nimbus-Cloud-Bridge

Nimbus-Cloud-Bridge is a decentralized multi-cloud application that allows users to store and access data on multiple cloud platforms, including Amazon Web Services (AWS), Google Cloud Platform (GCP), and Microsoft Azure. The application provides a unified API that can be used to interact with all three cloud providers, as well as a decentralized database that ensures data privacy and security.

## Getting Started

To get started with Nimbus-Cloud-Bridge, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the necessary dependencies using `npm install`.
3. Configure the environment variables for the cloud providers you wish to use.
4. Run the application using `npm start`.

## Architecture

The architecture of Nimbus-Cloud-Bridge consists of several key components:

- **Decentralized Database**: The database component of the application uses encryption and sharding to ensure that data is stored securely across multiple cloud providers. This ensures that data is not stored in a single location, reducing the risk of data loss or breach.

- **Cloud Provider Integrations**: Nimbus-Cloud-Bridge includes integrations for AWS, GCP, and Azure, providing a unified API that can be used to interact with all three cloud providers. The integrations handle the necessary translations and conversions between the different cloud provider APIs.

- **Serverless Computing**: The application uses serverless computing components to handle certain tasks, such as scaling and event-based triggers. This reduces the need for dedicated servers and can help lower costs.

- **Web Interface**: Nimbus-Cloud-Bridge includes a web interface that allows users to interact with the application and manage their data on the different cloud providers.
